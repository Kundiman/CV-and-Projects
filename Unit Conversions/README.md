# Unit Conversions
 - Developed a dynamic and responsive Unit Conversion Website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, enabling users to perform real-time conversions for temperature, weight, and distance. The project features a clean and intuitive navigation bar for seamless switching between conversion categories.

## Key functionalities include:
- Temperature Conversion: Converts Celsius to Fahrenheit using both input fields and a conversion formula displayed for user reference.
- Weight Conversion: Converts kilograms to pounds with interactive input fields and a clear explanation of the calculation process.

- Distance Conversion: Converts kilometers to miles with an integrated formula and real-time result display.


- Each conversion section is enriched with visuals, including icons and images, to enhance user experience and context. The website leverages JavaScript for DOM manipulation, enabling smooth interactions such as button-triggered conversions and dynamic updates to the UI. This project highlights proficiency in building user-focused, interactive web applications with a focus on clarity and functionality.
